# Stach

Work in Progress.... Not usable yet!
Many features may not work properly yet... if in fact they work at all!

# Goal of the project

GJCR is a nice tool, but the current version didn't really suit me anymore and I did feel some improvements were required, and that is where Stach will come in.
The name "Stach" is a referrence to the main protagonist of the Dutch children's novel "Koning van Katoren", written by Jan Terlouw.
